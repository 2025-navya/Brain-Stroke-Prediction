**Brain Stroke Prediction**
This project predicts the likelihood of a brain stroke based on various health-related parameters using machine learning.
**
**Project Description**
In this project, we predict the likelihood of a brain stroke based on factors such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Hypertension
- Heart disease
- Marital status
- Work type
- Smoking status

We use classification models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest to predict stroke risk and evaluate the models' performance.

**Files**
- `app.py`: Flask application for the web interface.
- `model.py`: Contains the code for training the model and making predictions.
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

**How to Run**
1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project folder:
3. Install dependencies:
4. Run the app:

**python app.py**
The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
